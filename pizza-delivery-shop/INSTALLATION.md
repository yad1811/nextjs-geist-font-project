**Override in your theme's style.css:**
```css
/* Change primary color */
.pds-add-to-cart {
    background-color: #your-color !important;
}

/* Customize product cards */
.pds-product-item {
    border: 2px solid #your-color;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### 2. Product Images
Add product images by entering image URLs in the product form:
```
https://your-website.com/images/margherita-pizza.jpg
```

### 3. Email Notifications
The plugin sends order confirmation emails. Customize the email template by adding this to your theme's functions.php:
